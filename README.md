# Time is Money Meteor App

Time is money is a quote often heard but seldom understood.  In transportation time spent waiting is literally money loss for owner/operators.

Time Is Money is an Android app that determines how long drivers are waiting at a shipper, receiver or ramp.

It would allow owner/operators and dispatcher to choose whether to proceed with the dispatch or reschedule the appointment.

There would be notifications that alert the dispatchers and drivers of the number of drivers waiting as well as the wait time.

It would also give a real time ETAs for drivers.
